            <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes 
                added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
                It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases

            <p>Prior to the invention of the ice cream scoop employees would use two ladles or spoons, then transferring the scooped mound to the serving dish. 
                In 1876 George William Clewell invented a single cone shaped utensil which allowed a scraper to move around the interior of the chamber and release the ice cream.
                This invention had limitations as the person operating it would require both hands to operate the mechanism, in addition to the cone-shaped device being awkward for harder ice cream that came from newer freezers.
                Modern day scoops follow the ice cream from freezing to the scoop's metal bowl.

            <p>Cones, in the form of wafers rolled and baked hard, date back to Ancient Rome and Greece. When exactly they transitioned to being used for desserts, and ice cream in particular, is not clear. Some historians point to France in the early 19th century as the birthplace of the ice cream cone: an 1807 illustration of a Parisian girl enjoying a treat may depict an ice cream cone[2] and edible cones were 
                 mentioned in French cooking books as early as 1825, when Julien Archambault described how one could roll a cone from "little waffles".[3] In 1846, the Italian British cook Charles Elmé Francatelli's The Modern Cook described the use of ice cream cones as part of a larger dessert dish.[4]

            <p>Ice cream is a colloidal emulsion made with water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air.[52][53] Water and fat have the highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion that has dispersed phase as fat globules. The emulsion is turned into foam by incorporating air cells which are frozen to form dispersed ice cells. The triacylglycerols in fat are nonpolar and will adhere to themselves by Van der Waals interactions. Water is polar, thus emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also, ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in its light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to its consistency. The proteins contribute to the emulsification, aeration and texture. Sucrose, which is a disaccharide, is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose, which is sugar present in milk, will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will remain unfrozen and will not give a hard texture.[54] Too much lactose will result in a non-ideal texture because of either excessive freezing point depression or lactose crystallization.[55]</p>
