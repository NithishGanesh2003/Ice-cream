            <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes 
                added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
                It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases

            <p>Prior to the invention of the ice cream scoop employees would use two ladles or spoons, then transferring the scooped mound to the serving dish. 
                In 1876 George William Clewell invented a single cone shaped utensil which allowed a scraper to move around the interior of the chamber and release the ice cream.
                This invention had limitations as the person operating it would require both hands to operate the mechanism, in addition to the cone-shaped device being awkward for harder ice cream that came from newer freezers.
                Modern day scoops follow the ice cream from freezing to the scoop's metal bowl.

            <p>Cones, in the form of wafers rolled and baked hard, date back to Ancient Rome and Greece. When exactly they transitioned to being used for desserts, and ice cream in particular, is not clear. Some historians point to France in the early 19th century as the birthplace of the ice cream cone: an 1807 illustration of a Parisian girl enjoying a treat may depict an ice cream cone[2] and edible cones were 
                 mentioned in French cooking books as early as 1825, when Julien Archambault described how one could roll a cone from "little waffles".[3] In 1846, the Italian British cook Charles Elmé Francatelli's The Modern Cook described the use of ice cream cones as part of a larger dessert dish.[4]
